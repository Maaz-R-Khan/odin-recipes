    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Butter Chicken, also known as <strong>Murgh Makhani</strong>, is a classic Indian dish that combines tender chicken pieces with a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce. This dish is known for its luxurious texture and mild yet flavorful spices, making it a favorite in Indian cuisine.</p>
        <p> The origins of Butter Chicken can be traced back to Delhi, India, where it was first created in the 1950s. Traditionally, the chicken is marinated in a mixture of yogurt and spices, then cooked in a tandoor (a type of clay oven) before being simmered in a velvety sauce made with butter, cream, and tomatoes. This dish is typically served with naan, roti, or steamed rice, and it is loved by people of all ages for its delicious, comforting flavors.</p>

           <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>

<h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
